# pixeldetail

Create a new image from an existing image which shows the detail of every pixel.

The `pixeldetail.py` Python 3 program takes an existing image and produces a new
image file which shows every pixel in detail. 

A picture says a thousand words
so lets say you have an image three pixels wide and two pixels tall. The pixels on the top row are
coloured red, green and blue. The pixels on the bottom row are black, white and grey.
